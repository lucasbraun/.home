h1. Installation

Installation is very simple, you just have to clone this repository to your home dir:

@git clone git@github.com:lucasbraun/.home.git $HOME/.home@

cd into the newly created directory Clone to necessary submodules:

@cd $HOME/.home && git submodule update --init

cd into the newly created directory and run make install:

@cd $HOME/.home && make install@

.home will then create symlinks in your home dir to adjust $PATH as well as preferences for different tools.

In order to install all, plugins, open vim and enter
@:PluginInstall

This will usually work for OS X - for other systems (and may be even OS X) you might want to make sure that YCM is compiled. For instance, for Ubuntu, you need to execute the following commands:

@cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
@./install.py --clang-completer

After the installation completed, run :PluginInstall again.

Additional details for YCM can be found on:
