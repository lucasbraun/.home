This is my home dir, settings for zsh, dot files and so on ...

h1. Installation

Installation is very simple, you just have to clone this repository to your home dir:

@git clone git://github.com/mpilman/.home.git $HOME/.home@

cd into the newly created directory and run make install:

@cd $HOME/.home && make install@

.home will then clone the oh-my-zsh repository (if necessary) and create a symlink in your home dir .zshrc to adjust $PATH as well as set zsh preferences.

This will usually work for OS X - for other systems (and may be even OS X) you might want to make sure that YCM is compiled.
