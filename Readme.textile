h1. Installation

Installation is very simple, you just have to clone this repository to your home dir:

@git clone git://github.com/lucasbraun/.home.git $HOME/.home@

cd into the newly created directory Clone to necessary submodules:

@cd $HOME/.home && git submodule update --init@

cd into the newly created directory and run make install:

@cd $HOME/.home && make install@

.home will then create symlinks in your home dir to adjust $PATH as well as preferences for different tools.

In order to install all, plugins, open vim and enter
@:PluginInstall@

This will usually work for OS X - for other systems (and may be even OS X) you might want to make sure that YCM is compiled. For instance, for Ubuntu, you need to execute the following commands:

@cd $HOME/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe@
@./install.py --clang-completer@

After the installation completed, run @:PluginInstall@ again.

Additional details for YCM can be found on:
@https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe@

If you want to use auto-completion for Haskel, make sure you have ghc-mod, codex, hasktags, and hoogle installed, if not do:
@stack install ghc-mod codex hasktags hoogle@

Also make sure, ghc-mod is on your path. On Ubuntu, for example, this means to add the following lines to your .bashrc and .bash_profile if not already there:
@export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin@

To make the Haskel-Plugin work, execute:
@cd $HOME/.vim/bundle/vimproc/@
@make@
